## Overview

Utilizing Rebrickable's LEGO catalog database, I created a single page React App that show cases various LEGO sets. To test my skills, the app utilizes routing, nested routing, state, useEffect, RESTful convention, and the Semantic UI React.


## Get Started

My project is deployed [here](https://spiffy-starship-82124d.netlify.app/) or copy and paste this link https://spiffy-starship-82124d.netlify.app/ to your browser. Please note, I am using render as the backend host and the responses to the fetch request to this server may take several seconds up to a minute to receive. 

If you want to locally deploy a copy, follow the steps below:

- Clone this repo
- Install [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- Run `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`.
- Run `npm start`
- Enjoy checking out the various LEGO sets!
