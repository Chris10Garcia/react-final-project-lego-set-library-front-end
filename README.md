## Overview

Utilizing Rebrickable's LEGO catalog database, I created a single page React App that show cases various LEGO sets. To test my skills, the app utilizes routing, nested routing, state, useEffect, RESTful convention, and the Semantic UI React.


## Get Started

- Clone the repo
- Install [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- On one terminal, run `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`
- On a second terminal, run `npm start`
- Enjoy checking out the various LEGO sets!
