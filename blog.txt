- In React, a virtual DOM is created to allow more efficient browser DOM manuiplation and re-renderings. 
- To have React know and update which components when a change in information occurs, it utilzies "state". 
- State of a component is an object that holds information that may change over time and / or due to interactions by the user. 
- This allows React to know when to re-render the component
- And within a recent update to React, hooks are introduced to allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class (https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

- Before we begin, there are some import rules for hooks
    - Only call hooks at the top level of a function component! Think of it similarly to the import statement
    - You can't call hooks inside loops or conditions.
    - Hooks can only be called from React Functions.

to begin, you need to import useState from the react library


`import React, { useState } from 'react'`
